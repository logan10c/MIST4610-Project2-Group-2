Description:
The objective of this project is to design, model, and implement a comprehensive relational database for the 2024 NFL season. The core focus of the system is the NFL Team entity, which is connected to related entities such as Players, Coaches, Referees, Broadcasters, and other operational components of the league.
The project focuses on:
- Developing a complete Entity-Relationship model that accurately represents the structure and interactions of NFL organizations during the 2024 season.


- Populating the database with detailed and realistic season data, including team rosters, game schedules, officiating crews, broadcast assignments, and statistical outcomes.


- Writing and executing SQL queries to efficiently retrieve meaningful insights from the database, such as team performance metrics, player statistics, and game reporting details.
- Creating Data Visualizations to effectively and easily convey the information contained within our database.

By the end of the project, we will have a fully functioning database system that provides valuable visibility into the dynamics and analytics of the 2024 NFL season.
Note that we could not find complete accurate data for Broadcasting Crews and Player Start +  End Dates.
